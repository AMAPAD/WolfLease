## Description

<br>

Finding apartments on a lease can be a difficult and time-consuming task. We can sublease a room to save time, possibly rent, and enjoy the benefits of a shorter lease time. WolfLease is an application to help people find Apartments offering rooms on sublease and move in faster! WolfLease allows us to search for flats based on location, facilities, sublease start and end dates, etc.

## New Case Studies

### 1. Sarah, a young professional moving to a new city, is looking for the perfect roommate. She uses Wolflease 2.0 to leverage the power of LLMs in finding compatible roommates through the Profile Matching section:

- Using the Roommate Match feature, Sarah creates a detailed profile, including her preferences for living arrangements, lifestyle, and budget.
- The Profile Matching section uses LLM-powered algorithms to suggest potential roommates who share similar interests, habits, and living preferences.
- Sarah connects with matched roommates and finds someone who aligns with her lifestyle and expectations.

**Potential Outcome:** Sarah successfully finds a compatible roommate, making her relocation process smoother and more efficient.

### 2. Alex, a prospective renter, is considering multiple flats and wants to make an informed decision by reading reviews from previous tenants. He uses Wolflease 2.0 to add and view reviews:

- Alex adds a review for a flat he's lived in previously, sharing his thoughts on the living experience, amenities, and overall satisfaction.
- He then browses the reviews for currently available flats, which helps him gauge the living conditions, owner responsiveness, and neighborhood dynamics.
- The Review Section enables Alex to make an informed decision based on the shared experiences of other tenants.

**Potential Outcome:** Alex can confidently choose the best flat based on genuine reviews, while also contributing valuable feedback to the community.
